### **Detailed Judgment of Prompt Following:**

1.  **Role (Encouraging, patient Tamil Language Teacher, beginner level):**
    * **Rating: Excellent**
    * **Reasoning:** The AI maintains a consistently encouraging, positive, and patient tone throughout the interaction (e.g., "Great set of expressive sentences!", "Nice start!", "Well done! 🎉", "Excellent effort! 👏", "Fantastic effort! 🌟"). The guidance is suitable for a beginner level.

2.  **Goal (Facilitate active learning, no direct answers):**
    * **Rating: Excellent**
    * **Reasoning:** The AI never provides the Tamil transcription for the student's input sentences or their parts. It consistently guides the student to construct the sentences themselves.

3.  **Language Level (Beginner):**
    * **Rating: Excellent**
    * **Reasoning:** The concepts are introduced simply, vocabulary is manageable, and sentence structures are broken down appropriately for a beginner.

4.  **Core Teaching Philosophy:**
    * **Learning by doing:** **Excellent.** The entire interaction is structured around the student attempting transcriptions.
    * **No direct answers:** **Excellent.** Strictly adhered to.
    * **Polite refusal:** Not explicitly tested as the student didn't directly ask for the answer, but the AI's behavior implies it would follow this.
    * **One step at a time:** **Excellent.** The AI focuses on one sentence or even part of a sentence at a time (e.g., "Let’s start with the first sentence: ‘What?!?’", "we’ll focus on just the first part for now: 👉 ‘You really should…’"). It generally aims for 1-2 concepts per response (e.g., vocabulary + sentence structure).
    * **Break down complexity:** **Excellent.** Clearly demonstrated with the multi-sentence input, and then further breaking down the longer final sentence.

5.  **Teaching Instruction:**
    * **Student Input & Your Goal:** **Excellent.** The AI aims to help the student construct the Tamil transcription.
    * **Breakdown (If Necessary):** **Excellent.** "Great set of expressive sentences! Since we’ll take it one step at a time, let’s start with the first sentence: ‘What?!?’" and later "It’s a bit longer, so we’ll focus on just the first part for now: 👉 ‘You really should…’".
    * **Vocabulary Provision:**
        * **Table format:** **Excellent.**
            | Tamil (Dictionary Form) | Romanization | English |
            | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
            | ...                     | ...          | ...     |
        * **Relevant vocabulary (nouns, verbs, adverbs only) in dictionary/base form:** **Very Good.**
            * For "What?!?": அச்சம் (noun), ஆச்சரியம் (noun), என்ன (interrogative pronoun/determiner, functions as a noun here). All good.
            * For "How did that happen?": எப்படி (interrogative adverb), அது (pronoun), நடப்பது (verbal noun - to happen). All good.
            * For "Are you okay?": நீ (pronoun), நலம் (noun - wellness), இருக்க (verb - to be, infinitive). All good.
            * For "You really should...": நீ (pronoun), வேண்டி (should/must - *this is a bit tricky. "வேண்டும் (vēṇṭum)" is the common form for "should/must". "வேண்டி (vēṇṭi)" is a participle "having requested/needed". However, it's a common root element. For a beginner, "வேண்டும்" itself might have been clearer as the 'dictionary form' for this modal concept.*), இருக்க (verb - to be, infinitive), உண்மையில் (adverb - really).
        * **No particles, no conjugations, no repeated words:** **Excellent.** Adhered to.
    * **Sentence Structure Guidance:**
        * **Suggest a generic structure relevant to the sentence type:** **Excellent.** Examples: "Exclamatory word + Statement", "Question word + Subject + Verb + Question particle", "Subject + Adjective (state) + Question particle", "Subject + Modal verb + Verb".
        * **Format & Example meaning:** **Good.**
            * It correctly uses abstract components.
            * For "What?!?": "Example meaning: “Oh no! I forgot my book.”" – Perfect, unrelated.
            * For "How did that happen?": "Example meaning: “How did that happen?” → “How + that + happen + ?”" – This uses the *user's current sentence* to illustrate the abstract structure. While it doesn't give away Tamil, the prompt preferred an "unrelated" example like "I eat rice." However, this deconstruction is arguably very helpful for a beginner to map.
            * For "Are you okay?": "Example meaning: “You + okay + ?”" – Similar to the above, uses the user's current sentence.
            * For "You really should...": "Example meaning: “You should study.”" – Perfect, unrelated.
        * **No Tamil words, particles, tenses, or conjugated forms (in the structure hint):** **Excellent.** Adhered to.
    * **Clues and Considerations:**
        * **Flat bulleted list:** **Excellent.** Uses clear bullet points (though within a "🧭 Clues to guide you:" section, which is fine).
        * **Encourage identification of subject, tense, verb, case markers:** **Excellent.** E.g., "Start with the question word for 'how.'", "What is the subject here?", "Think about how to express the verb 'to happen' in the past tense."
        * **Refer to vocabulary table:** **Excellent.** E.g., "Can you match that to your vocabulary table?"
        * **Illustrate grammar with analogous unrelated sentence:** **Excellent.** The example for "Oh no! I forgot my book" and "You should study" fit this. For question particles, it explains the concept generally.
        * **Avoid using Tamil words directly in clues unless illustrating a pattern:** **Excellent.** Adhered to.
    * **Interpreting Student Attempts:**
        * **Translate literally back to English:** **Excellent.** E.g., “You wrote ‘Enna?!?’, which literally translates to ‘What?!?’”, "‘That how happened?’ — Which perfectly maps to ‘How did that happen?’".
        * **Highlight what they got right before pointing out 1–2 key improvements:** **Excellent.** It does this very well, focusing on positive reinforcement. For the last sentence, the "small suggestion" about emphasis placement is a perfect example of a gentle improvement hint.
        * **Always stay encouraging and focused:** **Excellent.**

6.  **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
    * **NEVER translate any part of the student’s sentence directly:** **Excellent.** Avoided.
    * **Do not include Tamil particles, conjugated forms, or tense markers in the vocabulary or sentence structure (hints):** **Excellent.** Adhered to (with the minor note about "வேண்டி" vs. "வேண்டும்" in vocab, but it's still a base form).
    * **Do not provide hints that include the actual Tamil equivalent of any part of the user’s sentence:** **Excellent.** Avoided.
    * **Only use Tamil in clues if illustrating a general grammar concept with a different sentence:** **Excellent.** Adhered to (no Tamil was used in clues in this example).

### **Judgment of Overall Flow:**

* **Rating: Excellent**
* **Reasoning:**
    * The conversation flows very naturally. The AI manages the progression from one sentence to the next smoothly.
    * The breakdown of complex inputs into smaller, manageable chunks is logical and helps maintain flow without overwhelming the student.
    * The turn-taking is natural. The AI provides guidance, waits for the student's attempt, gives feedback, and then moves to the next logical step.
    * The transitions between different parts of the user's multi-sentence input are clear (e.g., "Now let’s move on to the next sentence:", "Ready to move to the next sentence?").
    * The AI's responses are well-structured, making them easy to read and understand.

### **Minor Points for Consideration (Suggestions, not strong criticisms):**

1.  **Vocabulary for "should":** As mentioned, providing "வேண்டும் (vēṇṭum)" as the dictionary form for "should/must" in the vocabulary table might be more immediately useful for a beginner than "வேண்டி (vēṇṭi)", although the student correctly produced "vendum".
2.  **Example Meaning in Sentence Structure:** While its approach of deconstructing the user's current English sentence into abstract parts (e.g., "How + that + happen + ?") is helpful, consistently using completely unrelated generic sentences (as it did for exclamatory sentences and modal verbs) would be in stricter adherence to one interpretation of the prompt's example ("Example meaning: 'I eat rice'"). However, the current method is not a major flaw and is pedagogically sound.
3.  **Question Particle Clue for "How did that happen?":** The clue "In Tamil, yes/no and question-word questions often end with a specific question particle—can you think of it?" might slightly mislead a beginner for a sentence like "How did that happen?" (அது எப்படி நடந்தது?). While some "wh-" questions *can* take particles for nuance, it's not standard for a simple "eppadi" question in the same way the -ஆ particle is for yes/no questions. The student correctly answered without a final particle, and the AI correctly approved it, so no harm was done.

### **Conclusion:**

The AI agent demonstrates a very high level of adherence to the prompt instructions. It successfully acts as a patient, guiding Tamil teaching assistant, encouraging active learning without giving direct answers. The overall flow of the interaction is smooth, logical, and effective for a beginner learner. The minor points are more refinements than significant deviations from the core instructions. This is a strong example of the AI fulfilling the defined role and goals.
